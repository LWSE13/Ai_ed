					As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into classrooms, 
					it brings both exciting opportunities and complex ethical challenges. 
					From protecting student data to ensuring fairness in algorithms, 
					educators must carefully consider how AI is implemented and used. 
					This page explores key issues surrounding AI in education.

					It is important to develop responsible, human-centred technology that
					supports learning while upholding trust and integrity. Below, we've
					highlighted key ethical challenges and concerns related to privacy,
					bias, transparency, and accountability. Click on the accordion

							<p>
								AI systems in education can involve the collection and processing of student data (e.g., learning interactions and personal information). Institutions should apply strong safeguards and transparent data policies, and ensure compliance with relevant requirements such as GDPR and FERPA (Garzón et al., 2025; Labadze et al., 2023; European Parliament and Council, 2016; US Department of Education, n.d.).

							<p>
								AI models can reproduce or amplify bias present in training data, which may contribute to unfair outcomes in assessment or recommendations. Regular auditing, representative data and fairness evaluation are important to support equity (Baker and Hawn, 2022; Garzón et al., 2025).

						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								Many AI tools provide outputs without clear explanations of how decisions were reached. In education, explainability supports trust, accountability and informed use by teachers and students (Feldman-Maggor and Sandler, 2025).

						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>
								AI tools can support learning, but they can also enable plagiarism or over-reliance on generated content. Clear guidance on acceptable use and assessment designs that emphasise reasoning and originality can help protect academic integrity (Bittle and El-Gayar, 2025; Labadze et al., 2023).
