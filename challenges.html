						As artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into classrooms,
						it brings both exciting opportunities and complex ethical
						challenges. From protecting student data to ensuring fairness in
						algorithms, educators must carefully consider how AI is implemented
						and used. This page explores key issues surrounding AI in education

					It is important to develop responsible, human-centred technology that
					supports learning while upholding trust and integrity. Below, we've
					highlighted key ethical challenges and concerns related to privacy,
					bias, transparency, and accountability. Click on the accordion

								AI systems in education often collect vast amounts of student
								data, including learning patterns, behaviors, and personal
								information. Protecting this sensitive data is crucial to
								maintain student privacy and comply with regulations like FERPA
								and GDPR. Schools must ensure that AI tools have robust security
								measures and transparent data policies.

							<p>
								AI algorithms can perpetuate or amplify existing biases if
								trained on biased data sets. In education, this could lead to
								unfair assessment outcomes, unequal learning opportunities, or
								discriminatory recommendations. It's essential to regularly
								audit AI systems for bias and ensure diverse, representative
								training data to promote equity in education.

							<p>
								Many AI systems operate as "black boxes," making decisions
								without clear explanations of how they arrived at those
								conclusions. In educational settings, transparency is vital so
								teachers and students understand how AI tools make
								recommendations or assessments. Clear documentation and
								explainable AI help build trust and enable informed
								decision-making.

							<p>
								The use of AI tools raises questions about academic integrity
								and authentic learning. While AI can assist with learning,
								there's concern about students using AI to complete assignments
								without genuine understanding. Educators must establish clear
								guidelines on appropriate AI use and design assessments that
								encourage critical thinking and original work rather than
								AI-generated responses.
