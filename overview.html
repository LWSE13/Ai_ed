							Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in education to
							support teaching and learning through tools such as adaptive
							learning systems, intelligent tutoring, and automated assessment
							and feedback. These systems can analyse learner data to tailor
							content and support, and are becoming a notable part of modern
							educational practice (Wang et al., 2024; Garzón et al., 2025).
						</p>
						<p>
							Rather than replacing teachers, AI is typically framed as a
							support technology that can reduce routine workload and provide
							additional insight into student progress. This can help educators
							spend more time on high-value tasks such as guidance, classroom
							interaction, and personalised support (Merikko and Kivimäki, 2022;
							Garzón et al., 2025).

					At its core, AI in education focuses on using data-driven methods to
					detect patterns in learning, provide timely feedback, and support
					decision-making for teaching and student support. When implemented
					responsibly, these tools are intended to complement human teaching,
					not substitute it, helping teachers prioritise meaningful interaction
					and pedagogical judgement (Wang et al., 2024; Merikko and Kivimäki,
					2022).

						<h3 class="card-title">Personalized Learning</h3>
						<p class="card-description">
							AI enables learning systems to adapt content, pace, and feedback
							to individual students. By analysing learner data, AI can identify
							strengths and gaps in understanding, allowing instruction to be
							personalised rather than standardised (Vorobyeva et al., 2025;
							Garzón et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024).

					<!-- Card 2 -->
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3 class="card-title">Time Savings for Teachers</h3>
						<p class="card-description">
							AI can automate routine tasks such as grading, feedback and
							administrative reporting, reducing workload and enabling teachers
							to focus on planning and student support (Garzón et al., 2025;
							Merikko and Kivimäki, 2022).

					<!-- Card 3 -->
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3 class="card-title">Accessibility & Inclusion</h3>
						<p class="card-description">
							AI can support inclusive learning through assistive and adaptive
							tools, such as speech recognition, translation and personalised
							scaffolding for diverse learners (Garzón et al., 2025; Labadze et
							al., 2023).
						</p>

					<!-- Card 4 -->
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3 class="card-title">Data-Driven Insights</h3>
						<p class="card-description">
							AI can analyse educational data to identify patterns in engagement
							and performance, supporting early intervention and evidence-based
							decisions (Wang et al., 2024; Garzón et al., 2025).
						</p>

					<!-- Card 5 -->
					<div class="benefit-card">
						<h3 class="card-title">24/7 Support</h3>
						<p class="card-description">
							AI chatbots and tutoring systems can provide on-demand help
							outside class time by answering questions and offering
							explanations, supporting self-paced learning (Labadze et al.,
							2023; Vorobyeva et al., 2025).
