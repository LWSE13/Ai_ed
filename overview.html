							Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the education
							landscape by reshaping how students learn and how teachers teach.
							From personalized learning platforms to automated grading systems,
							AI is becoming a powerful tool that enhances both efficiency and
							engagement in classrooms.
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead of replacing teachers, AI acts as a supportive assistant,
							helping identify learning gaps, adapting materials to individual
							needs, and freeing up educators to focus on creativity and
							connection. By combining human insight with intelligent
							technology, education is becoming more inclusive, efficient, and
							tailored than ever before.

                    At its core, AI in education focuses on analysing patterns, predicting individual needs, and optimising the learning 
                    journey through intelligent algorithms. From recommending customised study materials to providing real-time feedback, 
                    AI systems are designed to improve outcomes and reduce the workload on educators. When implemented correctly, these 
                    tools serve to complement human teaching rather than replace it, allowing teachers to focus on meaningful interaction 
                    and high-value tasks.
